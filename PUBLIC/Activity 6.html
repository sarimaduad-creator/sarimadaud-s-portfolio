    <p>
        My name is Sarima Daud. <a href="../PUBLIC/Activity 3.html"> I was born on March 7, 2007</a> and i am currently 18 years old. Daughter of Kimar Daud and Roaida Daud.
        I grew up in a big family with five siblings, which helped me learn the importance of love, patience, responsibility, 
        and cooperation. Being part of a large family taught me how to share, understand others, and value strong family relationship.
        but at the age of 12 my father passed and i feel so lost that time since i am a papa's girl.

        I am currently staying in a boarding house located in Purok Leonila, Ipil Heights. Living away from my family has helped me 
        become more indeendent and responsible. I manage my daily tasks on my own, budget my expenses, and focus on my studies.
