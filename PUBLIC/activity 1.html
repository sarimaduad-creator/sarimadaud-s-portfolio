    <h2> HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE (HTML) </h2>

    <h3> Is responsible of the content of the Website </h3>

    <p> First paragraph. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard used to create and structure content on 
    the Web. It provides the basic building block for webpages by defining elements like headings, paragraph, 
    links, images, and multimedia. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to mark up content, enabling 
    browsers to interpret and render it visually for users. For example, the p tag define a paragraph, while the 
    a tag creates hyperlinks, making HTML the backbone of web navigation and content presentation. HTML is a
    foundational technology of the web and works seemlessly with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and 
    JavaScript for interactivity. It is designed to be both human-readable and machine-interpretable, allowing
    developers to build structured documents. With advancement like HTML5, the language has incorporated support
    for rich media, such as video, audio, and interactive elements, without requiring additional plugins. 
    This has made HTMKL more versatile and integral to modern web development.

    <h2> CASCADING STYLE SHEETS (CSS) </h2>

    <h3> Is responsible of the style of the Website </h3>

    <p> Second paragraph Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the visual 
    presentation of a document written in markup language like HTML. CSS allows developers to separate content 
    from design by specifying styles such as color, fonts, layout, and spacing. This separation enables more
    efficient and consistent design management, as changes to styles can be made in one place and applied 
    across multiple pages or elements. CSS operates in a cascading manner, meaning that styles can be layered 
    and prioritized based on rules of inheritance and specifity, giving developers fine-grained control over
    the appearance of web content CSS is an essential part of modern web development because it enhances the
    users experience by making web pages visually appealing and interactive. It supports responsive design,
    enabling website adapt seemlessly to different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, CSS can be applied
    inline (within HTML elements), internally (in the style tag), or externally (via linked css files), 
    with external stylesheet being the most common and scalable approach Advanced features of CSS, such as 
    animations, transitions, and grid or flexbox layouts, allow developers to create dynamic and 
    sophisticated web design without relying heavily on JavaScript.</p>

    <h2> JAVASCRIPT (JS) </h2>

    <h3> Is reponsible of the functionality of the Website </h3>

    <p> JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily designed for creating iteractive and
    dynamic web applications. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, enabling
    developers to build responsive user interfaces and add interactive features such as animations, form 
    validations, and real-time updates. javaScript is executed in web browsers, allowing it to modify the
    content and behavior of web pages without needing to reload them. This client-side capability has made 
    it indespensable for modern web development. Beyond the browser, JavaScript has expanded its reach with
    platforms like Node js, which allows developers to write server-side code. This versatility has 
    transformed JavaScript into a full-stack language capable of handling both front-end and back-end 
    development. Additionally, it supports numerous frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, 
    and Vue js, which streamline the development process and help create feature-rich applications. Its 
    ability to work across platforms and its continous evolution have made JavaScript one of the most popular
    programming language in the world.</p>
